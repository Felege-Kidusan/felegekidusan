# Manual coverage and verification queue

[Manual index](README.md)

**Overall status: INCOMPLETE — ADDITIONAL WORK REQUIRED.** Baseline `7209278`, 2026-10-28. This ledger records reviewed scope and outstanding work; it is not a statement that every listed file is a reachable screen or that every control works.

## Evidence boundaries

- Three task/control chapters cover mobile Profile/device settings, updates and recovery. Six screen-directory source files have UI-level coverage; selected backing paths are traced. This is not full backend/domain-worker review.
- A read-only extraction found 140 source files containing 2,985 text/control candidates before vendor/legacy/dynamic review. Those figures are **discovery counts**, not verified button counts, manual coverage percentages or executed tests. Text candidates include headings and exclude some dynamic controls. The raw research inventory stays outside maintained manuals.
- Every tracked Dart source in the screen directory is listed below, including helpers/style files. Every direct dashboard/frontend PHP source is queued separately; legacy routing/reachability must be checked before describing it as active.
- Runtime verification of these new chapters on a phone/browser/hosting is not performed. Source references establish only the behavior specifically reviewed.
- No complete all-button catalog or per-action permission matrix has been verified. Do not describe this edition as exhaustive.

## Department and workflow queue

| Area | Required remaining trace and manual work |
|---|---|
| Public website and registration | Public pages/gallery/forms, validation, duplicate policy, result/recovery and privacy; root handlers |
| Web account/shared navigation | Login/logout/account, year context, menus, notifications/messages, danger confirmations and accessibility |
| Education | Classes, subjects, teachers/assignments, enrollment, calendars/timetable, assessments, approval/reopen/return states, grades/report cards, every web/mobile control |
| Teacher / education attendance taker | Assignment/class/year scope, offline class-day gates, QR/marking, save/submit/Undo/review and lesson attendance |
| Attendance coordination | Monthly rollups, warnings/follow-ups, department status/policy/takers, permission differences and report actions |
| Human Resources | Temporary/permanent registration/promotion, import, duplicates, guardians/family links, groups, identity/ID cards and archive/report workflows; retired HR attendance must not be described as active |
| Information | Member editing/archives, reporting datasets/saved views/exports, analytics and PII boundaries |
| Mezmur / Mezmur attendance taker | Catalog/categories/zemarians, submissions, media/lyrics timing/playback/downloads, attendance/review/analytics and curator ownership |
| Finance | Trace active web route, frontend script, compatibility shim and endpoint actions before promising transaction/report functions. Mobile home is a website notice, not a transaction UI |
| Materials | Trace web dashboard and endpoint actions; mobile home is a website notice, not inventory entry |
| Content Editor | CMS/public-content controls, publication effects, uploads, preview and permissions; mobile support must not be inferred from role existence |
| School Admin | Department overview, impersonation/restoration, configuration, branding, reporting, account management boundaries |
| Super Admin | Users/roles, backups/restore/health, identity, release manager, telemetry/failure intelligence and optional AI provider/chat controls; destructive/secret/privacy boundaries |
| All domains | Per-control conditions, exact labels, handler/API/service, persistence, confirmation, success/failure recovery; dynamic/shared controls and older installed clients |

## Mobile source queue

Statuses below apply only to the stated review depth. “Pending” means not yet approved as manual behavior, even if extraction has discovered labels.

## Web dashboard/frontend source queue

These files include legacy implementations, shims and shared widgets. Each needs routing, page admission and action-level review. Standalone `admin/*.php`, shared components, generated JavaScript controls and public root pages are additional scope, not implied complete by this list.

## Validation and release gates

1. Complete source/permission/control coverage by domain; distinguish discovery, source review and execution.
2. Review existing canonical/historical documents individually; retire only verified obsolete artifacts after reference/knowledge checks.
3. Review each visible wording change independently; preserve selectors, identifiers, permissions, contracts and logic.
4. Pass documentation links/anchors, include/boundary checks, focused regressions and applicable full suites. Record exact commands and limitations.
5. Validate the final user manual with representative synthetic-data journeys and accessibility/responsive states; export only reviewed content.
6. Commit/push, pass fresh required checks and merge development main within authorization. Owner acceptance and production promotion remain separate.

The publication of these three chapters does not complete the full documentation-renewal request. Incomplete coverage is an acceptance gap, not a mere optional improvement.
