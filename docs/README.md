# Documentation index

**Status labels**

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Canonical** | Maintained. Describes the current system. If it disagrees with the code, the code wins; fix the document |
| **Reference** | Accurate for its narrow topic |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by the linked canonical document; kept for context |
| **Historical** | A point-in-time record (rollout, incident). Useful for *why*, not for *what is true now* |

## 8. Sources of truth

When documents disagree, use this table.

| Question | Authoritative source | Not authoritative |
|---|---|---|
| What is the code? | The exact reviewed development-main SHA. Production promotion is separate; parity is not assumed | Unreviewed feature branches; `dev` (beta settings) |
| What is deployed? | A dated [deployment record](../CHANGELOG.md#production-deployment-record) corroborated by authorized file/schema/configuration verification | A merge alone, server-side Git metadata or an old deployment record used as a live guarantee |
| What is the database schema? | The actual target database, through separately authorized structural verification; see [DATABASE.md §4](DATABASE.md#4-applied-state-in-production-unverified) | `sql/legacy/database_schema.sql` (stale); migrations alone do not prove applied state |
| Which app version is in the field? | Installed-device evidence for the devices concerned; release-manager metadata identifies the offered release, not every installed build | `pubspec.yaml` on `main`, a successful build or a download alone |
| Who may do what? | `admin/access_control.php`, `api/v1/core/acl.php` and the checks inside each endpoint | Older documents |
| Why is it built this way? | [Architecture decision records](adr/README.md) | — |
| Security and privacy findings | Tracked privately ([SECURITY.md §5](SECURITY.md#5-open-findings)) | This repository |
