# Mobile Fleet Telemetry — Retention and Lifecycle Phase

**Scope:** diagnostic telemetry lifecycle only

**Policy:** retain `app_telemetry_events` and `app_downloads` for 90 days

**Status:** source and static-contract verified; cron installation, PHP runtime,
MariaDB execution, and staging behavior are `NOT VERIFIED` in this workspace.

## 1. Boundary

The cleanup target is deliberately limited to:

```text
app_telemetry_events.created_at
app_downloads.downloaded_at
```

The job does **not** delete or update:

- `app_installations` aggregate rows;
- `api_sync_attempts` server-observed monitor rows;
- `api_idempotency_records`;
- mobile SQLite outbox tables;
- attendance, grades, HR, communication, or other user-data tables.

The mobile outbox/user-data lifecycle remains independent from diagnostic
telemetry retention. A telemetry age horizon must never expire unsent user work.

## 2. Implementation

The CLI target is:

```text
admin/backend/mobile_telemetry_retention.php
```

It is:

- CLI-only;
- deployment/cron-owned;
- protected by a non-blocking file lock;
- fail-closed when the database or required telemetry tables are unavailable;
- bounded to 5,000 rows per delete statement;
- bounded to 10 batches per table per invocation;
- safe to run repeatedly;
- aggregate-only in its output, with no event payloads, installation IDs, or
  download metadata printed.

When the maximum batch count is reached, the output reports:

```json
"backlog_possible": true
```

The next scheduled invocation continues the cleanup. This prevents a large
historical backlog from creating one unbounded database lock.

## 3. Required deployment schedule

First identify the deployed CLI PHP binary:

```bash
command -v php
php -v
php -m | grep -Fx mysqli
```

Install a daily cron outside the application request path. The paths below are
examples and must be replaced with the deployed paths:

```cron
23 3 * * * umask 077 && /usr/local/bin/php "/home/ACCOUNT/public_html/admin/backend/mobile_telemetry_retention.php" >> "/home/ACCOUNT/mobile_telemetry_retention.log" 2>&1
```

The log must remain outside the web root and must not contain database
credentials, tokens, event payloads, installation IDs, or member data.

## 4. Manual staging verification

After applying migrations `051`, `059`, and `060` to an authorized staging
database:

```bash
cd "/path/to/deployed/SSMS"
/usr/local/bin/php admin/backend/mobile_telemetry_retention.php
printf 'exit=%s\n' "$?"
```

Expected successful output shape:

```json
{"lock_acquired":true,"retention_days":90,"batch_size":5000,"max_batches_per_table":10,"deleted_events":0,"deleted_downloads":0,"event_batches":1,"download_batches":1,"backlog_possible":false}
```

Counts vary. The output must not expose row contents.

Verify with aggregate-only database queries:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS old_events
  FROM app_telemetry_events
 WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 90 DAY);

SELECT COUNT(*) AS old_downloads
  FROM app_downloads
 WHERE downloaded_at < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 90 DAY);

SELECT COUNT(*) AS monitor_rows
  FROM api_sync_attempts;
```

Run the cleanup again. It must be idempotent and must not change
`api_sync_attempts`.

A controlled disposable staging database may contain approved age-separated
rows for this verification. Do not insert fabricated telemetry or monitoring
rows into a shared staging or production environment merely to make the job
appear successful.

## 5. Failure and rollback

A failed run prints only:

```text
Mobile telemetry retention failed.
```

The detailed exception remains in the server's private PHP error log. Exit code
`1` is the operational failure signal.

If the cron fails:

1. disable only this retention cron entry;
2. preserve the database and application data;
3. inspect the private error log and schema preflight;
4. correct the deployment or database issue;
5. rerun manually until exit code `0` and valid aggregate JSON are observed;
6. re-enable the cron.

Rollback is operational: remove or disable the cron entry. No schema rollback
is required because this phase adds no database schema and does not modify
request-time behavior.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The script is unreachable through a browser request.
- [ ] The script deletes only the two approved telemetry tables.
- [ ] Each delete is bounded and ordered by the table's primary key.
- [ ] A concurrent run exits safely without deleting rows.
- [ ] Missing schema fails closed before cleanup.
- [ ] The job never touches `api_sync_attempts` or mobile user-data tables.
- [ ] A second run is idempotent.
- [ ] The cron log remains outside the web root.
- [ ] Staging execution and aggregate reconciliation are recorded.
- [ ] Production sign-off includes the actual installed cron evidence.
