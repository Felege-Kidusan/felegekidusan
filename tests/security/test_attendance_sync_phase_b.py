"""PHASE B: the Flutter attendance consumer of the server change feed.

There is no Dart or Flutter executable in this sandbox, so this file is
deliberately split in two, and it is explicit about which half proves
what:

  * SqliteCursorRuntimeTests execute REAL SQLite 3 through Python using
    the REAL table declaration loaded out of local_schema_v34.dart. They
    prove the cursor storage behaves — defaults, idempotent replay,
    advance-only-on-commit, rollback leaving the cursor untouched. That
    is genuine runtime evidence, following the approach already used by
    test_mobile_v34_sqlite_runtime.py.

  * CoordinatorContractTests read the Dart source. They pin the wiring
    decisions that a runtime harness in another language cannot honestly
    verify, and they are NOT a substitute for running the Dart.

WHAT IS STILL UNVERIFIED: the Dart itself has never been compiled or
executed. applyAttendanceDelta's sheet patching, the coordinator's
paging loop and the SyncService wiring REQUIRE FLUTTER VERIFICATION on a
real Flutter environment. The Dart-side behavioural tests live in
Mobile/wbws_flutter_app/test/attendance_sync_coordinator_test.dart and
have not been run.

Baseline relevance
------------------
Before this phase sync_service.dart was upload-only: its sole download
path, cacheForOffline(), refetched dashboard stats and the class list.
No cursor existed anywhere in the app, so a record another device
changed or deleted stayed wrong in the local cache indefinitely. Every
assertion here fails on that baseline.
