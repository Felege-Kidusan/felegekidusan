"""S2 Goal A.6 — the v36 -> v37 upgrade path, executed against real SQLite.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.

The v37 *create* path was already covered (test_mobile_sync_attempt_ledger.py
builds the shipped ledger in a real SQLite database). The gap was the path
every ALREADY-INSTALLED device takes:

    existing v36 database -> onUpgrade(db, 36, 37) -> v37 database

This module closes that gap as far as this repository's frozen environment
allows, and is explicit about the boundary:

  * REAL SQLITE IS USED. Every assertion below runs against a real sqlite3
    connection, with real DDL, real rows, real PRAGMA introspection and real
    constraint enforcement. Nothing here is a text match on the migration.

  * THE PRODUCTION DART FUNCTION IS NOT EXECUTED. `LocalDb._open` calls
    sqflite's `openDatabase(... onUpgrade: ...)`. sqflite has no
    implementation on a Linux CI host: it needs an Android/iOS platform
    binding, or `sqflite_common_ffi`, which is NOT in pubspec.lock and cannot
    be added because F-19 freezes pubspec.yaml/pubspec.lock. No Dart test in
    this repository opens a database for exactly this reason.

    So the Dart control flow of the v37 branch is REPRODUCED here, while the
    SQL it executes is EXTRACTED FROM THE PRODUCTION SOURCE at test time and
    never retyped. If production's ALTER, its guard, its CREATE or its schema
    version changes, these tests change with it or fail. That is materially
    stronger than a reproduction, and still weaker than running the Dart.
    The S2 A.6 document states this in the same terms.

  * The same boundary already applies to the pre-existing create-path
    evidence, which uses this identical mechanism.

VERSION BOOKKEEPING. The app never writes the schema version itself; it
passes `version: localDatabaseSchemaVersion` to sqflite, and sqflite records
it in `PRAGMA user_version`. The harness therefore reproduces that step too,
reading the target version from the production constant rather than hardcoding
37, and the existing v34 runtime harness uses the same PRAGMA.
